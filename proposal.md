#Description
I would like to create a simple game- adding some fun space/alien themeing or mechanics and attempt to remake the classic computer game mine-sweeper, from scratch. People who work in a technical field have to problem solve all the time, so it would be a good test for me to create a logic puzzle game- which in itself is a bit of a logic puzzle to work properly. I think it would be doable with the lessons we have learned to this point.

#Planned Features
-I plan to include a system that is able to detect and store the status of each adjacent tile in lists, so that the mechanic of solving where adjacent mines may be is possible- and accurate tile graphics may be displayed when necessary.

- By default, I will begin with a 10x10 board. I will need to create graphics such as a blank tile, numbers 1-8, and a flag. I will use photoshop for this job, since I currently have access to Adobe Creative Cloud at a reduced student price.

-Speaking of the flag, I will need to add the ability to override the graphic of a tile with the flag if the player right clicks instead of left clicks. 

-I may add a timer, for replayability's sake, and the ability to reset but the most important thing is that the game's graphics are not innacurate to the state of the game and that it is POSSIBLE to win , even if it proves to be difficult to win.

-If time permits, I could play into the space aesthetic by perhaps introducing a second type of trap- the black hole. It could move existing bombs randomly mid-game from their original positions to shake things up.

-Another idea if time permits, would be an earnable hint in currently unopened territory. 

-Finally I could allow different visual themes in the settings for the user to decide the color of the window and buttons for visibility and comfort to the eye.


#Challenges

-I will need to research the specific rules involved with minesweeper and ensure I understand them to prevent mistakes in the logic before I try bending things creatively. 

-I must remain honest with myself, to get the most out of this project.
What that means is setting a consistent schedule for myself with an attainable goal. 

-This will require somewhat advanced data collection that is not hardcoded- so that the game will be randomized and different each time you play.

-I will need to look back at our lessons on updates, but prompt them to update only when the player makes a choice- then still lay frozen when untouched.


#Outcomes

-Ideally, I will not only recreate minesweeper from scratch, but also input unique space-themed mechanics to match the visual design. But I want the game to work above all else, and be intuitive. The game should not be unfair, and these unique mechanics should have a scarcity and balance as not to intrude fully on the integrity of the puzzle component.

-At the very least, the bare minimum is to succeed at coding a tile based logic puzzle computer game that does not break no matter what square the player chooses at a given time.


#Educated Guess on a Weekly Schedule

-We have about 4 weeks for this project. I should strive to spend at least as much time working each week as I did on my rain lab.

-Week 1: I want to jump right into researching the logic system of the game- and experimenting in VS code to find a storage system that works- I feel that will be the most difficult part of this project.

-Week 2: I want to create all my grahics so I can prototype the storage system more effectively later- simply with a click and reveal mechanic to check that things are even randomizing properly. Randomization is something I should get working for this list system this week- bug testing it extensively, and preparing the bomb if time permits.

-Week 3: Work on the bomb if I was unable in week 3, and make it display on the board too- randomize the amount, but create a visible counter for the player to know how many remain- get the click mechanics for left and right click to work perfectly- consider the way hitboxes might work.

-Week 4: Polish, and add whatever brand new elements of theme I can without breaking the core experience in a way that harms its value as a puzzle game.
